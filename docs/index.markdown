# About me

I am a second-year PhD student at the University of Edinburgh, and my interests broadly lie in the fields of explainable AI (XAI), causal reasoning, and conversational agents.
Most current post-hoc XAI systems rely on a combination of black-box systems and surrogate models to generate explanations based on, for example, feature importance.
However, these are difficult to justify in terms of the causality behind the black-box system that generated our decisions.
What is worse, the generated explanations are expert-oriented which ignore real human requirements, such as intelligibility or dialogue.

To give satisfying answers to real-world questions we must incorporate the appropriate causal information into natural language replies, while taking into consideration the cognitive biases of people.
Appealing to the social nature of people requires a dialogue-oriented explanation process and a focus on human evaluation.

My current research focuses on building human-centric trustworthy AI for autonomous vehicles to support their wider public adoption.
I gave a detailed outline of my vision for this project in an award winning [essay](assets/IEEE_ITS_Essay.pdf) and a [blog post](https://agents.inf.ed.ac.uk/blog/explainable-autonomous-vehicle-intelligence/).
In particular, I am looking to achieve this goal by integrating causally explainable methods with autonomous vehicle motion planning (e.g. [IGP2](https://www.five.ai/igp2) [Albrecht et al., 2021]) and semantic dialogue systems to deliver relevant explanations about the behaviour of the vehicle.


## Bio

I am originally from the small suburban town of GÃ¶d located some 30 minutes north of Budapest, Hungary.
I received my undergraduate degree from the University of Edinburgh gaining a first-class integrated master's degree in informatics (MInf).
I also studied abroad for a year at the Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.
My thesis supervisor was [Maria Wolters](https://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/people/staff/Maria_Wolters.html) with whom I worked on understanding how and why users deleted or hid their user accounts on social media during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic.

I have also completed a research internship at [Five](https://www.five.ai/), where I helped with the evaluation of the interpretable goal-based motion planner for autonomous vehicles called [IGP2](https://www.five.ai/igp2).


## Personal

I often spend my free time learning languages. Currently, I speak five. In decreasing order of fluency these are: Hungarian, English, German, Japanese, and Russian.

I like playing volleyball and I am currently the treasurer of the Edinburgh University Volleyball Club. My favourite position to play is the setter.
I also enjoy walking with people among the stark landscapes of the Scottish Highlands and taking some breath-taking photos while enduring harsh weather.

Occasionally, I sit down to practise the piano. At the moment, I am working through the second movement of Schubert's piano sonata in B-flat major ([D 960](https://youtu.be/MAZ8PA5_gVA)).
Currently, I am reading The Player of Games by Iain Banks. A list of books I have read since I have begun keeping records is [here](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/62432429).
