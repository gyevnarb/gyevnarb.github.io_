I began researching how we might make better explanations for autonomous vehicles. 
I quickly realised along the way that the current state of **explainable AI (XAI) is broken**.
Existing methods only work for some models with particular asumptions, they ignore OOD data, always assume that the AI model is correct, and so on...

Worst of all, most of XAI is unapproachable to most ordinary folks who have no expertise with AI systems.
This inspired me to look into exploring better ways to create **intelligible explanations that calibrate trust** according to the abilities of the autonomous system.

I am interested in **creating more trustworthy autonomous systems** that are based on intelligible causal explanations and provide recourse through a conversational process.

As part of an interdisciplinary team, I work with people from fields such as reinforcement learning, cognitive science, natural language processing, and autonomous driving.


## Tidbits about me

I often spend my free time learning languages. Currently, I speak five. In decreasing order of fluency, these are: <br /> Hungarian (native), English (fluent), German (fluent), Japanese (conversational), and Russian (beginner).

I like playing volleyball and I am currently the vice president of the Edinburgh University Volleyball Club.
I play the setter position.
I also enjoy walking with people among the stark landscapes of the Scottish Highlands and taking some breathtaking [photos](https://www.instagram.com/balinthy/) while enduring harsh weather.

Occasionally, I sit down to practise the piano.
At the moment, I am working through the second movement of Schubert's piano sonata in B-flat major ([D 960](https://youtu.be/MAZ8PA5_gVA)).
Currently, I am reading "Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid" by Douglas R. Hofstadter. 
A list of books I have read since I began keeping records is [here](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/62432429?sort=date_read).
