# about me

I am first-year PhD student at the University of Edinburgh, and my interests broadly lie in the fields of explainable AI, causal reasoning, and conversational agents.
Most explainable AI systems rely on post-hoc explanations based on e.g. feature importance, however these explanations are difficult to justify causally and only provide instance-level explanations which often ignore the overall structure of the decision making process.
To give satisfying answers to real-world questions we must incorporate the appropriate causal information into our replies, while appealing to the social nature of people requires a dialogue-oriented approach to the explanation process.

My current research focuses on building [trustworthy AI](https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/ai-alliance-consultation.1.html) for autonomous vehicles to support their wider public adoption. 
In particular, I am looking to achieve this goal by integrating causally explainable methods with autonomous vehicle motion planning (e.g. [IGP2](https://www.five.ai/igp2)) and semantic dialogue systems to deliver relevant and timely explanations about the behaviour of the car.


## bio


## personal

I often spend my free time learning languages. Currently, I speak five. In decreasing order of fluency these are: Hungarian, English, German, Japanese, and Russian.

I like playing volleyball and I am currently the treasurer of the Edinburgh University Volleyball Club. My favourite position to play is the setter.
I also enjoy walking with people among the stark landscapes of the Scottish Highlands and taking some breath-taking photos while enduring harsh weather.

Occasionally, I sit down to practise the piano. At the moment, I am working through the first movement of Schubert's piano sonata in B-flat major ([D 960](https://youtu.be/MAZ8PA5_gVA)).
Currently, I am reading Dune by Frank Herbert. A list of books I have read since keeping records is [here](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/62432429).
